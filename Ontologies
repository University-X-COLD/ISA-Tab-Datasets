Using and Reusing Ontology Terms

The BioPortal Ontologies embedded in ISA-Tab give us the ability to restrict the metadata elements and fields to a limited selection. 
[BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org) provides access to life science ontologies and terminologies for scientific experiments. Be aware that terms have a "life cycle", starting with their creation and ending with their obsolescence. You should check the status of a term before using it. Terms that should no longer be used are marked as *obsolete*.
